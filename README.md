# box-shooter
Third project for a coursera specialization. 

Level 1 is basically the same from the tutorials.
For level 2, I intended to create kind of a cinematic/narrative level before actually going to level 2, but I have failed for several reasons.
My first intentions, was a completely dark box-room level, where you fire only light. Them, after shooting some light it would reveal the "paradox", a weird sphere like object. So, by shooting several light projectiles against the "paradox", level 2 would load and all the textures and materials would have changed as well to create an outer environment. . Like if you were escaping from the box world.
From now on, the boxes would pursue you because you escaped their prision.
But, I have failed.

--- SPOILER ALERT --- From this point, only read after playing!

So, I reused what it would be my cutscene/narrative level to make my level 2. By doing so, I tried to create three possible experiences:
First, you can play the game normally, shooting things and beating the score.
Second, as you will notice, there are several glowing projectiles like "raining". Here you can simply wait and see how randomness plays the game by dropping random rain projectiles over random spawned boxes. Also, this is a real good view, feels like a rain on light if you disable the enemy spawner =).
Third, you can fire at what I was going to use as the "paradox". The weird sphere like object below you by the begining. When you shoot at it, your bullets ricochet almost randomly. It's like a particle effect of projectiles driven by you! lol.
Thanks, hope you enjoy it.
